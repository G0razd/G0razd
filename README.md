- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @G0razd
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making apps more user accesible and bridgeing gaps between developers and content managers. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to curate my online presence and focus my time, energy and attention effectively.
- ğŸ’» I've used Gatsby and Strapi on most of my early projects, since then I've moved to Next.js and Directus for better dev and user experience.
